## Mates

### Back-Rank

> A Back-Rank Mate is a checkmate delivered by a rook or queen along the back rank in which the mated king is unable to move up the board because the king is blocked by friendly pieces (usually pawns) on the second rank.

### Hook

## Tactics

### Fork

> A fork is a tactic whereby a single piece makes two or more direct attacks simultaneously. Most commonly two pieces are threatened, which is also sometimes called a double attack. The attacking piece is called the forking piece; the pieces attacked are said to be forked.

### Zwischenzug

> A Zwischenzug is when a player, instead of playing the expected move, often a recapture, plays another move that makes an immediate threat that the opponent must answer, before playing the original expected move.
