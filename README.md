## Mates

### Back-Rank

> A Back-Rank Mate is a checkmate delivered by a rook or queen along the back rank in which the mated king is unable to move up the board because the king is blocked by friendly pieces (usually pawns) on the second rank.

### Hook

Rook delivering mate while protected by a knight. 
The knight is in turn protected by another friendly piece
The escape route left by the attacking rook and knight is either blocked by one of the king's own pieces, or protected by another piece of the mating side.

Knight protects king escape square that has a rook on
