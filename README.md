How to find `Qf7+` with the tactic `Removal of the defender of f8 square`. Or if `Removal of the defender of d8 square` tactic works, this line could be achieved `Qa8+ Bd8 Qxd8#`.

Tactics will try lines where the idea is executed even though it doesn't work. For example for Backrank mate tactic, a check on the back rank will be tried even though it results in a capture, or block. This line will give the relevant square idea for the tactic Removal of the defender of relevant square.
